### Shiny apps
I have developed a number of [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) apps using open data.

<div class="cols">
<img src="img/STATS19_scanner.gif" width="400">

The [STATS19 scanner](https://pracademic.shinyapps.io/STATS19_scanner/) allows users to interrogate road casualties reported in Greater London between 2005 and 2015. A GitHub repo containing all of the R code and data can be found [here](https://github.com/rcatlord/shinyapps/tree/master/STATS19_scanner).

<div class="cols">
<img src="img/brexit.gif" width="400">

The [EU referendum](https://pracademic.shinyapps.io/brexit/) app uses voting data from [The Electoral Commission](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/upcoming-elections-and-referendums/eu-referendum/electorate-and-count-information) to explore the relationship between the votes cast during the UK's EU Referendum (23 June 2016) and immigration levels by local authority. The app was inspired by a recent article in [theconversation.com/uk](http://theconversation.com/uk) called ['Hard Evidence: how areas with low immigration voted mainly for Brexit'](http://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-areas-with-low-immigration-voted-mainly-for-brexit-62138)
</div>

<div class="cols">
<img src="img/crime_map.gif" width="400">

The [Crime map](https://pracademic.shinyapps.io/crime_map/) app enables users to interrogate [open source police crime data](https://data.police.uk/) recorded by Greater Manchester Police during 2015.

### Crime analysis in R
I am building a GitHub repository with re-usable code that enables R users to tidy, summarise, and (interactively) visualise [open crime data](https://data.police.uk). The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/rcatlord/crime_analysis).
